When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If there are people who want to collaborate with me or check my work, they can see it in my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I rather check the code first before making the pull becasue I am not sure if the remote code will be a good fir for my local repository.
