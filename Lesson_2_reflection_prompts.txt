What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git starts tracking your project (all the files) amd keep hsitory of the changes. If you donlt init there is not repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

in the staging area we add the files we are modifying and we want to commit in the repository. It is a temporary place to maintain organized the fiels we work with

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I will just add to the stage area only the files that are related with the logical change, that will keep only those modifications together in the commit.
