Q.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git starts tracking your project (all the files) amd keep hsitory of the changes. If you donlt init there is not repository.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

in the staging area we add the files we are modifying and we want to commit in the repository. It is a temporary place to maintain organized the fiels we work with

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I will just add to the stage area only the files that are related with the logical change, that will keep only those modifications together in the commit.

Q. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I want to experiment with a new feauture of the program without compromissing the production system. I can keep modifying programs in my Branch and te Production files are intact in the Master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can see easily how the branches are splited from the master, what commits belong to the master and what cimmits belong to a branch. I would like to see a command that shows all the branches from a repository.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

After merging to branches the commits include all the changes done separedtly and they are sorted by timestamp, that means one commit cold be followed by other that is not he parent, then to see the difference between the son and parent we should use the git show commit-id to see the difference, also after merging it is a good idea to erase the LABEL of the branch.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Pros, it is easy to incliude code from one branch to another, the software will merge the changes faster than doing it manually.

Cons: If developers are changing the same code simultaneosly then we have to check those changes manually before we actually merge. We need to decide what will be the final code that will remain at the end.
