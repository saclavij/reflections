I am reviewing this class because I am goign to have a Part Time Job in Python by January 2026

It is a good idea to have control of the versions in the system.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With git log I can see all the commits done tho the project and with git diff I can see what was modified and where.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

If i can eturn to a previous stage when my project was working peefectly I won't be affaid of trying other approaches to solve a problem (Risk Taker!!).

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

When you've updated your document, click "Next" and we'll wrap up the lesson.

I want to master Git and Github to find a position in Python programing.
