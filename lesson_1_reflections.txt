How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I will have access to the previous versions of the program in case I need to change some lines of code or in case other programmer has to modify the programs.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I want to have control and decide when to save the commits, it is like creatimg Restoring Points on Windows.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
This is a very powerfull GIT's option, is like CAP, (Computer Assisted Programming), it helps to control all the functions and code that are interconnected, I am wondering is how GIT knows what parts are connected, it is automatic?, it is created on the repository?
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log will give you the history of the commint and changes, also the git diff will show exactly what were those changes
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I will have the control to return to a previous version that worked perfectly and keep track of the changes
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to start playing withe the code, I want to chek different versions and ckeckoyt different commits
